==================================
::INSTALLATION:: (DO THIS FIRST BEFORE ANYTHING!)
==================================

NOTE: THIS PROGRAM REQUIRED CRYSTAL REPORT 8.5, if you don't have that reporting tool
      then the reporting in this project will not run! :-(

-The program required the fallowing ActiveX Controls which I created to run!
  -ctrlNSDataCombo.ocx 
  -StyleButtonX.ocx
  Can be download at: http://www.prjsmiascontrols.cjb.net

-You need winzip or winrar to extract the compressed files.
-If you did not have winrar installed then goto www.rarlab.com and download it!,
 then istall it (winrar is much better and faster than winzip).
-Extract the controls.zip to the directory where SMIAS.VBP is located.

NOTE: The ActiveX hereof are safe! I use it for lot of my projects. 
      The ctrlNSDataCombo.ocx is a newly created controls so please tell me if you 
      found some bugs on it. :-)

"All these came complex because pscode did not allowed to upload dll's and ocx files"

TO PSCODE MODULATOR: Please inform me how to upload files with dll and ocx coz every time
                     I upload the files dll and ocx was deleted.

::MESSAGE FROM THE AUTHOR::
==================================
-The reason why I share some of my files is not boast my skill or to be a coder of the month
 to win some software and ebooks(I already have it!).I share code to help other develop to stand with
 their own knowledge.I need your vote as acknowledgement of my work only.

-I've been sharing some codes at www.pscode.com in the past year but I was discourage to share
 onother code due to I saw my programs in thesis and commercial projects and they claim that they
 did it (co'z I ask the them) without giving any credits to me.That is the reason why I stop sharing codes
 but  as many developers that are willing to learn e-mail me and asking for help ,I encourage to share
  another codes."GOD SAID IT IS BETTER TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE"

 THAT'S ALL AND THANKS FOR READING!!!!!!!!!!!!
 IF YOU BARROWED SOME CODES GIVE A CREDIT TO THE AUTHOR!!!!!!
 PLEASE VOTE! COZ I CONSIDER YOUR VOTE AS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THIS WORK!!!!!!!!!!

 HELLO TO ALL MY FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!
 -> Hello sa tanan nga taga Kidapawan City
 -> Hello din sa lahat na BIBLE BAPTIST brothers and sisters! GOD BLESS YOU ALL! :-)
 -> Mabuhay ang Pinoy !
