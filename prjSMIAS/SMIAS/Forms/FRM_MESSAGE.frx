==================================
-The reason why I share some of my files is not boast my skill or to be a coder of the month
 to win some software and ebooks(I already have it!).I share code to help other develop to stand with
 their own knowledge.I need your vote as acknowledgement of my work only.

-I've been sharing some codes at www.pscode.com in the past year but I was discourage to share
 onother code due to I saw my programs in thesis and commercial projects and they claim that they
 did it (co'z I ask the them) without giving any credits to me.That is the reason why I stop sharing codes
 but  as many developers that are willing to learn e-mail me and asking for help ,I encourage to share
  another codes."GOD SAID IT IS BETTER TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE"

 THAT'S ALL AND THANKS FOR READING!!!!!!!!!!!!
 IF YOU BARROWED SOME CODES GIVE A CREDIT TO THE AUTHOR!!!!!!
 PLEASE VOTE! COZ I CONSIDER YOUR VOTE AS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THIS WORK!!!!!!!!!!
