::INSTALLATION:: (DO THIS FIRST BEFORE ANYTHING!)
==================================

NOTE: THIS PROGRAM REQUIRED CRYSTAL REPORT 8.5, if you don't have that reporting tool
      then the reporting in this project will not run! :-(

-The program required the fallowing ActiveX Controls which I created to run!
  -ctrlNSDataCombo.ocx 
  -StyleButtonX.ocx
  Can be download at: http://www.prjsmiascontrols.cjb.net

-You need winzip or winrar to extract the compressed files.
-If you did not have winrar installed then goto www.rarlab.com and download it!,
 then istall it (winrar is much better and faster than winzip).
-Extract the controls.zip to the directory where SMIAS.VBP is located.

NOTE: The ActiveX hereof are safe! I use it for lot of my projects. 
      The ctrlNSDataCombo.ocx is a newly created controls so please tell me if you 
      found some bugs on it. :-)

"All these came complex because pscode did not allowed to upload dll's and ocx files"

TO PSCODE MODULATOR: Please inform me how to upload files with dll and ocx coz every 
                     time upload the files dll and ocx was deleted.
